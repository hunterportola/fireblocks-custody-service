🚧 Critical Gaps for Production Demo

  1. Authentication & Authorization (HIGH PRIORITY)

  // Missing: Real authentication integration
  interface AuthenticationGaps {
    userManagement: "Mock authentication only - not connected to database";
    roleBasedAccess: "Basic roles defined but not enforced";
    multiTenancy: "No row-level security for originator isolation";
    sessionManagement: "No session handling or JWT implementation";
  }

  2. Frontend Application (REQUIRED FOR DEMO)

  The entire React frontend needs to be built from scratch with:

  Multi-Originator Dashboard Architecture

  interface OriginatorDashboard {
    // Loan Originator Specific Views
    disbursementManagement: {
      pendingDisbursements: "Real-time status dashboard";
      transactionHistory: "Filterable transaction logs";
      approvalWorkflows: "Multi-signature approval interface";
    };

    // Risk Management
    riskDashboard: {
      creditLimits: "Per-borrower exposure tracking";
      collateralHealth: "Real-time LTV monitoring";
      complianceAlerts: "KYC/AML status warnings";
    };

    // User Management
    userInterface: {
      teamManagement: "Role assignment and permissions";
      apiKeyManagement: "Automation user credential rotation";
      auditTrails: "User activity monitoring";
    };
  }

  3. Lending-Specific Policies (CRITICAL)

  Current policies are basic - need lending-specific implementations:
  interface RequiredLendingPolicies {
    creditPolicies: {
      ltvEnforcement: "Loan-to-value ratio validation";
      creditLimits: "Per-borrower aggregate limits";
      riskScoring: "Dynamic risk-based approvals";
    };

    compliancePolicies: {
      kycValidation: "Identity verification requirements";
      amlScreening: "Sanctions and PEP checks";
      travelRule: "Transaction reporting thresholds";
    };

    operationalPolicies: {
      multiSigTiers: "Risk-based approval requirements";
      velocityControls: "Transaction frequency limits";
      businessHours: "Time-based transaction restrictions";
    };
  }

  4. Real-Time Features (USER EXPERIENCE)

  interface RealTimeRequirements {
    webSocketIntegration: "Live transaction status updates";
    approvalNotifications: "Real-time consensus requirements";
    systemAlerts: "Risk threshold breach notifications";
    activityFeed: "Live audit log streaming";
  }

  The foundation is incredibly solid - the Turnkey integration, database design, and core custody operations are production-ready. The main effort will be building the React
  frontend and implementing the lending-specific business logic and policies that make this a compelling demo for loan originators.


• Core Architecture

  - src/core/turnkey-client.ts:210 boots a singleton around @turnkey/sdk-server, layers in secret management, activity polling, and helper workflows for provisioning wallets,
    automation users, and policies (src/core/turnkey-client.ts:652).
  - Provisioning is orchestrated by TurnkeySuborgProvisioner which stitches together wallet templates, partner overrides, automation creds, and resolved policy bindings into a
    persistable snapshot (src/provisioner/turnkey-suborg-provisioner.ts:62).
  - Runtime orchestration lives in TurnkeyCustodyService, which pulls a provisioning snapshot, resolves partner-specific wallet flow + automation context, and delegates signing to
    a pluggable executor (src/services/turnkey-custody-service.ts:242).
  - The executor today is Ethereum/USDC focused: it builds ERC-20 calldata, fetches gas params, calls Turnkey for signing/broadcast, and surfaces consensus-required responses back
    to the caller (src/services/turnkey-disbursement-executor.ts:204).

  Disbursement Flow

  - REST entrypoint authenticates the lender (currently mocked) and routes to custody service when the mock snapshot store is present (src/api/routes/disbursements.ts:203),
    otherwise falls back to the raw executor path.
  - Each request is translated from lender -> originator via static maps before calling TurnkeyCustodyService.initiateDisbursement, meaning multi-tenant routing depends entirely
    on pre-seeded provisioning data defined in the mock initialization layer.
  - TurnkeyDisbursementExecutor enforces token registry membership, account readiness, and handles Turnkey consensus errors distinctly so the API can respond with pending_approval
    instead of hard-failing (src/services/turnkey-disbursement-executor.ts:219).
  - Successful or failed attempts are persisted immediately through TenantDatabaseService.saveDisbursement, which captures status, Turnkey activity IDs, timeline stamps, and error
    payloads for later reconciliation (src/services/tenant-database-service.ts:166).

  Database Integration

  - Schema covers originators, hashed API keys, wallet metadata, disbursements, provisioning snapshots, and webhooks (database/init/01-schema.sql:26), but the running API still
    relies on JSON mocks for lenders and snapshots.
  - TenantDatabaseService supports originator lookups, disbursement CRUD with filtering, and snapshot persistence while enforcing isolation per originator via dedicated schemas/databases.
  - Seeds demonstrate branded originators, wallet flows, and daily disbursement history, but enum mismatches (transaction_chain vs stored values like sepolia) in the seed files
    will blow up once constraints are enforced—needs reconciliation before running migrations.
  Provisioning + Snapshot Roadmap

  - Move snapshot persistence onto the live tenant stores: update `TenantDatabaseService.saveProvisioningSnapshot` /
    `getProvisioningSnapshot` (src/services/tenant-database-service.ts:436) to write the `originator_id` primary key,
    persist the `ProvisioningArtifacts` JSON from `src/provisioner/runtime-snapshots.ts`, and shape `wallet_ids` to match
    the schema in database/init/01-schema-complete.sql:545.
  - Ship a production-ready snapshot store that implements `ProvisioningSnapshotStore` from
    src/services/turnkey-custody-service.ts:37. It should call `TenantDatabaseService.forOriginator` and persist the
    artifacts emitted by `TurnkeySuborgProvisioner.provision` (src/provisioner/turnkey-suborg-provisioner.ts:72), then
    serve snapshots back for disbursement flows.
  - Introduce a provisioning coordinator beneath the control plane service that invokes the provisioner, commits the
    snapshot store write, records automation credentials, and updates `tenant_registry.turnkey_suborg_id` /
    `turnkey_organization_id` via src/services/control-plane-service.ts:640. Roll failures back using existing
    `TurnkeyServiceError` handling.
  - Replace remaining mock snapshot wiring so production code resolves the database-backed snapshot store instead of hard-coded maps.

  Tenant API Key Management

  - Base the flow on existing types: `ApiKeyInfo` (src/services/control-plane-service.ts:75), `ApiKeyRecord` and
    `TenantUserRecord` (src/core/database-types.ts:83, src/core/database-types.ts:104), plus the tenant
    `user_credentials` table touched by `seedInitialAdminUser` (src/services/tenant-database-service.ts:582).
  - Extend `TenantDatabaseService` with helpers such as `createApiKeyCredential`, `revokeApiKeyCredential`, and
    `listApiKeyCredentials` that read/write tenant `user_credentials`, sharing the hashing logic that already powers
    `getUserByApiKey` (src/services/tenant-database-service.ts:508).
  - Build a `TenantApiKeyManager` service that composes the control-plane pool and tenant database service to issue,
    rotate, and revoke keys. Keep `control_plane_api_keys` and tenant `user_credentials` in sync, update usage metadata,
    and surface combined views for dashboards.
  - Refactor `ControlPlaneService.generateApiKey` / `revokeApiKey` callers (src/services/control-plane-service.ts:420)
    to route through the manager, and update `tenant-auth` middleware (src/api/middleware/tenant-auth.ts:52) to resolve
    keys through the manager so permission checks use the tenant-scoped credential rows.
  - Expose authenticated REST endpoints for tenant admins to manage keys, guarded by the permissions recorded in
    `TenantUserRecord.permissions`.

  Frontend + Policies Next

  - Build an originator configuration API (branding, feature toggles, wallet flows, policy assignments) surfaced from
    `originators` and the new provisioning snapshots; React can consume this to theme per sub-org and scope navigation.
  - Implement per-originator user/role management using the `accessControl.roles` metadata and Turnkey user tags
    (example-usage.ts:124), exposing CRUD endpoints that sync to Turnkey via `TurnkeyClientManager`.
  - Ship a starter policy catalogue: e.g., “standard USDC payout,” “high-value dual approval,” “whitelisted partner
    flows,” rendering into `accessControl.policies.templates` and binding rules (wallet template, partner, user_tag).
  - For the demo UI, plan tenant-aware dashboards: disbursement history (backed by the `disbursements` table), policy
    status (Turnkey activity polling hooks), and wallet balances; ensure theming pulls from `originators.branding` and
    feature flags (database/init/01-schema-complete.sql:26).
  - Before inviting a lender, persist real provisioning outputs, hydrate the snapshot store from Postgres end-to-end, and
    validate the flow against Turnkey sandbox credentials.
