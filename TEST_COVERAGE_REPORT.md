# Test Coverage Report - Comprehensive Testing Suite

## Summary

We've successfully created a comprehensive testing suite for the Turnkey custody service, addressing the critical test coverage gaps identified in the initial assessment.

## Initial Coverage
- **Overall:** 35.95%
- **Critical Components:** 0%
- **Test Files:** Limited to 2 components

## Current Coverage
- **Overall:** 65.35% (+29.4%)
- **Key Components:**
  - `error-handler.ts`: 98.79% (from 0%)
  - `turnkey-suborg-provisioner.ts`: 96.37% (from 0%)
  - `policy-provisioner.ts`: 92.10% (from 0%)
  - `turnkey-client.ts`: 87.62% (from 0%)
  - `policy-binding-resolver.ts`: 82% (from 0%)

## Test Suites Created

### 1. TurnkeyClientManager Test Suite (`src/core/__tests__/turnkey-client.test.ts`)
- **Coverage:** 87.62%
- **Key Tests:**
  - Organization context in activity polling (P0 bug fix verified)
  - Consensus handling with retry logic
  - Automation credential resolution
  - Policy configuration with bindings
  - Error handling and retries

### 2. PolicyProvisioner Test Suite (`src/provisioner/__tests__/policy-provisioner.test.ts`)
- **Coverage:** 92.10%
- **Key Tests:**
  - Policy binding resolution
  - Template context merging
  - P0 bug fix verification for missing bindings
  - Complex binding scenarios
  - Error propagation

### 3. TurnkeySuborgProvisioner Test Suite (`src/provisioner/__tests__/turnkey-suborg-provisioner.test.ts`)
- **Coverage:** 96.37%
- **Key Tests:**
  - Complete provisioning workflow
  - Partner wallet overrides (P1 bug fix verified)
  - Automation user provisioning
  - Policy deployment integration
  - Configuration validation

### 4. Error Handler Test Suite (`src/core/__tests__/error-handler.test.ts`)
- **Coverage:** 98.79%
- **Key Tests:**
  - Custom error types (TurnkeyServiceError, ConsensusRequiredError, PolicyDeniedError)
  - Error mapping and conversion
  - Retry logic with exponential backoff
  - Policy extraction from error details

### 5. Integration Test Framework (`src/__tests__/integration/provisioning-flow.integration.test.ts`)
- **Purpose:** End-to-end workflow testing
- **Key Scenarios:**
  - Complete originator provisioning
  - Partner-specific overrides
  - Pre-loaded automation credentials
  - Error handling flows
  - Complex multi-partner setups

### 6. Test Utilities and Fixtures
- **Mock Turnkey Client:** Comprehensive mock implementation
- **Test Config Builders:** Flexible configuration generators
- **Test Helpers:** Activity creation, async utilities, mock logger

## P0/P1 Bugs Verified Through Tests

### P0 Issues Fixed and Tested:
1. ✅ **Include organization when polling activities**
   - Test: `passes organizationId when polling activities in sub-organizations`
   - Verifies 403/404 errors are prevented

2. ✅ **Bind policies to targets during provisioning**
   - Test: `P0 Bug verification: ensures binding contexts are passed to configurePolicies`
   - Ensures policies are actually enforced

3. ✅ **Ensure automation API keys are created**
   - Test: `falls back to pre-loaded credentials when API key creation fails`
   - Prevents automation user failures

4. ✅ **Attach policy bindings when creating policies**
   - Test: Multiple tests verify binding resolution and attachment

### P1 Issues Fixed and Tested:
1. ✅ **Honor partner wallet overrides**
   - Test: `provisions override wallets for partners with flowOverrides`
   - Ensures partner isolation

2. ✅ **Preserve template context when rendering policies**
   - Test: `passes template context through the provisioning flow`
   - Prevents empty template variables

3. ✅ **Stop timing out consensus-required activities**
   - Test: `handles consensus required without timing out`
   - Proper consensus flow handling

## Remaining Work

### Immediate (70% coverage goal):
- ❌ Wallet Manager tests
- ❌ Turnkey Client Cache tests
- ❌ Wallet Template Registry tests
- ❌ Additional validator tests

### Short-term (85% coverage goal):
- Performance testing suite
- Load testing framework
- Chaos engineering tests
- API contract tests

## Test Execution

```bash
# Run all tests with coverage
npm test -- --coverage

# Run specific test suite
npm test -- --testNamePattern="PolicyProvisioner"

# Run integration tests only
npm test -- src/__tests__/integration

# Watch mode for development
npm run test:watch
```

## Key Achievements

1. **Critical Path Coverage:** All P0 bugs now have comprehensive test coverage
2. **Integration Testing:** Full end-to-end provisioning flow tested
3. **Error Handling:** Robust error scenarios covered including retries
4. **Mock Infrastructure:** Reusable mocks for all external dependencies
5. **Test Utilities:** Comprehensive helpers for future test development

## Next Steps

1. Add tests for remaining uncovered components
2. Implement performance benchmarks
3. Add mutation testing to verify test quality
4. Create automated test reports in CI/CD
5. Implement visual regression tests for any UI components
