- Handle blockchain-specific operations
- Monitor network performance and costs

### Key Components

#### Network Connections API
- Configure blockchain network connections
- Manage network routing policies
- Handle network-specific settings

#### Gas Stations API
- Optimize transaction fees
- Manage gas price strategies
- Handle fee estimation and prediction

#### Blockchains Assets API
- Manage blockchain-specific asset configurations
- Handle asset metadata and properties
- Configure blockchain parameters

### Key Features

- **Network Optimization**: Optimize transaction routing across networks
- **Gas Fee Management**: Intelligent gas fee optimization and prediction
- **Multi-Chain Support**: Support for multiple blockchain networks
- **Cost Optimization**: Minimize transaction costs while maintaining speed
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track network performance and reliability

### Supported Networks

- Ethereum mainnet and testnets
- Bitcoin and Bitcoin-based networks
- Layer 2 solutions (Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism)
