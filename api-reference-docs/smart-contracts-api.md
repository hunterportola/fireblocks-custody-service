## API Overview

The Smart Contracts API provides comprehensive functionality for managing smart contract interactions in Fireblocks. This includes contract templates, deployed contracts, and contract interactions. The API allows you to:

- Deploy and manage smart contracts
- Create and use contract templates
- Execute contract function calls
- Manage contract interactions and transactions

### Key Components

#### Contract Templates API
- Create reusable contract templates
- Manage contract ABIs and metadata
- Version control for contract templates

#### Deployed Contracts API  
- Deploy contracts from templates
- Manage deployed contract instances
- Track contract addresses and metadata

#### Contract Interactions API
- Execute smart contract functions
- Read contract state
- Handle contract events and logs

### Key Features

- **Contract Deployment**: Deploy smart contracts to supported blockchains
- **ABI Management**: Handle contract Application Binary Interfaces
- **Function Execution**: Call contract functions with proper encoding
- **Event Monitoring**: Track contract events and state changes
- **Gas Management**: Optimize gas usage for contract interactions

### Supported Blockchains

- Ethereum and EVM-compatible chains
- Layer 2 solutions
- Other smart contract platforms supported by Fireblocks
