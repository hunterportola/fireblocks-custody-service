# P1 Fix: Risk Assessment Guard

## Issue Summary
The `ConfigValidator.validateLoanPayload` function in `shared-config.ts` was vulnerable to null pointer exceptions. The validator directly accessed `loan.riskAssessment.score` without first checking if `riskAssessment` was a valid object, which would cause the validation to crash instead of returning `false` for malformed input.

## Fix Applied
Added proper type guards before accessing nested properties:

```typescript
// Before (vulnerable to null/undefined):
if (loan.riskAssessment.score < 0 || loan.riskAssessment.score > 100) {
  return false;
}

// After (properly guarded):
// Validate risk assessment object and score
if (!loan.riskAssessment || typeof loan.riskAssessment !== 'object') {
  return false;
}

if (typeof loan.riskAssessment.score !== 'number' || 
    loan.riskAssessment.score < 0 || 
    loan.riskAssessment.score > 100) {
  return false;
}

if (!['LOW', 'MEDIUM', 'HIGH'].includes(loan.riskAssessment.category)) {
  return false;
}
```

## Additional Improvements
Also added similar guards for other nested objects in the loan payload:
- `recipientDetails` - Validates object exists before accessing properties
- `loanTerms` - Checks object and validates Date instances
- `approval` - Ensures object exists and has valid array/Date values
- Added type checks for string fields like `amount` and `currency`

## Test Coverage
Added comprehensive test cases to verify the validator handles:
- `null` values for nested objects
- `undefined` values
- Non-object values (strings, numbers, etc.)
- Objects with missing required properties
- Objects with wrong property types
- Invalid enum values

All tests pass, confirming the validator is now robust against malformed input.

## Impact
This fix ensures the validator follows the expected behavior of returning `false` for invalid input rather than throwing runtime exceptions, making it safe to use with untrusted data.
