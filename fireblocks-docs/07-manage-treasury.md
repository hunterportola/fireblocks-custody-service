## Stake Assets {#stake-assets}

*Source: https://developers.fireblocks.com/docs/stake-assets*

Stake Assets
Overview
You can stake to various networks from your Vault using the Fireblocks API. When staking, you select a third-party staking provider to operate the validators associated with your staked funds. Typically, the staked amount is locked for a certain period of time.
Staked assets become eligible to receive rewards after the network's activation period. Staking rewards are calculated over a period of time usually known as an epoch. This is the period of time in which validators and their staked amount are accounted for. Depending on the network, an epoch may be anywhere from a few minutes to several days. Typically, staking rewards are calculated and distributed after each epoch ends.
When you unstake your assets, you no longer generate staking rewards, but you're able to use those assets for other transactions.
Staking via Fireblocks API
To stake, you must fund a vault account with the asset you want to stake and create
Policy
rules for staking. Then create staking transactions using the dedicated
staking API endpoints
.
Staking with the Fireblocks API allows you to:
Easily and securely stake assets through native API calls.
Create dedicated Policy rules for staking using the
Stake
operation type.
Track the status and rewards for your staked funds.
Initiate staking transactions without the need for SDKs, scripts, or Raw Signing.
Select validators to oversee your staked funds.

## Validate Balances {#validate-balances}

*Source: https://developers.fireblocks.com/docs/validate-balances*

Validate Balances
Fireblocks customers can create automated mechanisms to notify their organization about incoming transactions using the following methods:
Webhook notifications
Pulling the transaction history log using the Fireblocks API
When monitoring notifications through these methods, only consider incoming transactions for reconciliation after receiving a notification that the transactionâ€™s status has been updated to
COMPLETED
and the
VAULT_BALANCE_UPDATE
webhook has been received.
Fireblocks provides additional information to help clients validate and reconcile their balances according to the blockchain state. This information includes:
The
TRANSACTION_STATUS_UPDATED
webhook event contains the
blockInfo
object, which includes:
blockHeight
: The block height where the transaction was included
blockHash
: The block hash where the transaction was included
The
VAULT_BALANCE_UPDATE
webhook event contains the
blockHeight
and
blockHash
properties
The
GET /vault/accounts/{vaultAccountId}/{assetId}
endpoint returns the balance of an asset in a vault account and includes the
blockHeight
and
blockHash
properties
The
GET /transactions/{txId}
endpoint returns the transaction by its Fireblocks ID and includes the
blockInfo
object with the
blockHeight
and
blockHash
properties
Before crediting the end-user, customers need to run a reconciliation process to ensure that the incoming balance is accurately reflected and up to date according to the same
blockHeight
provided in the transaction notification object. If the balance is not up to date with the network state and the same height value, customers should not credit their clients until the issue is inspected and resolved.
Fireblocks strongly recommends checking the walletâ€™s balance using the Fireblocks API to verify that the deposit is included and the balance is up to date. This is crucial to prevent potential loss of funds from crediting end-clients before the balance is truly updated. While Fireblocks takes extensive measures to ensure the accuracy and reliability of its services, it is important for customers to implement all necessary validations and follow best practices to avoid any potential issues.

## Verify Fee Effeciency {#verify-fee-effeciency}

*Source: https://developers.fireblocks.com/docs/verify-fee-effeciency*

Estimate Transaction Fees
Fireblocks provides clients with two API endpoints to estimate transaction fees:
Estimate Transaction Fee
-
Documentation
Estimate Network Fee
-
Documentation
Estimate Transaction Fee
The
Estimate Transaction Fee
endpoint
is designed to simulate a real transaction and calculate its potential fee. This process considers factors such as the source and destination amounts, the number of inputs and outputs, and other relevant transaction details. Essentially, it mimics the actual transaction to determine what the fee would be if executed.
When using this endpoint, clients should be aware that it follows the same rules as creating a transaction. This includes requiring the relevant vault wallet in the vault account, ensuring the estimated transaction's balance is in the wallet, and providing a valid destination.
While many clients implement logic to estimate the transaction fee before each execution, it is crucial not to call this endpoint for every minor transaction change. For example, in EVM-based transactions, the gas limit for transferring the base asset or a specific token usually remains the same (barring sudden surges in network fees). The main variable is the current network fee, which can be obtained using the second endpoint.
Estimate Network Fee
The
Estimate Network Fee
endpoint
returns the current network fee for a specified network. This allows clients to calculate transaction fees or display the current network fee to their users. For instance, it provides the current gas price for ETH, which is part of the entire transaction fee formula, alongside the gas limit and other parameters.
The network fee response is cached for 30 seconds on the Fireblocks side. Clients should consider this interval when using this endpoint, as querying it more frequently than every 30 seconds does not provide additional value and the fee level value would remain the same.
Fee Levels
Both endpoints return estimated fees or network fees in three levels: LOW, MEDIUM, and HIGH. Hereâ€™s how these are determined for different transaction types:
EVM-Based Transactions
To simplify the gas calculation for each transaction, Fireblocks offers preset fees for both the Console (slow, medium, and fast) and the API (low, medium, and high). These fee calculations are based on recent blocks and a certain percentile of the data collected.
Fireblocks retrieves the latest block data every minute, inspecting the gas prices of recent blocks to determine the fee rate and automatically set the gas limit. In addition to verifying the latest data, Fireblocks also simulates the desired transactions to estimate the fee. The transaction parameters are sent to an API endpoint on the node, which returns an estimated transaction fee.
UTXO-Based Transactions
High
: Fees are based on the previous blockâ€™s fee.
Medium
: Fees are based on the average of the previous two blocks.
Low
: Fees are based on the average of the last four blocks.
Fireblocks' API endpoints for estimating transaction fees provide clients with robust tools to ensure they can accurately predict and manage transaction costs. By using these endpoints, clients can maintain efficient and cost-effective operations while offering transparency and predictability in transaction fees to their users. Whether you are dealing with EVM-based, UTXO-based transactions or any other type of blockchain, understanding and utilizing these endpoints can significantly enhance your transaction management strategy.

## Utxo Consolidation {#utxo-consolidation}

*Source: https://developers.fireblocks.com/docs/utxo-consolidation*

UTXO Consolidation
Prerequisites
Introduction
Quickstart Guide
API/SDK Overview
Overview
If you regularly run operations on the Bitcoin blockchain, you will likely notice that the list of UTXOs in your wallets grows very quickly. This is especially common in situations where you have multiple addresses used to consolidate into an
omnibus account
or just as part of an ongoing operation. This can be a major problem for retail-facing operations.
A process utilized by most companies is "consolidating UTXOs", or creating a transaction that will take many small unspent UTXOs and turn them into a single bigger UTXO.
This is done by creating an "internal" transaction within your own vault account that takes the maximum amount of inputs (250) and turns them into a single output.
Example
The logic to decide which unspent UTXOs to use can be as simple or complex as you wish, but in this example, we will use any small unspent UTXO that has received enough confirmations.
We have 3 steps in the process of consolidating UTXOs:
Retrieve the max spendable amount for a specific wallet.
This will result in an amount that considers up to 250 UTXOs within the wallet (by default, from smallest to biggest).
Create a transaction with the amount provided.

const getMaxSpendableAmount = async (
  assetId: string,
  vaultAccountId: string,
): Promise<GetMaxSpendableAmountResponse | undefined> => {
  try {
    const maxSpendableAmount = await fireblocks.vaults.getMaxSpendableAmount({
      vaultAccountId,
      assetId,
    });
    console.log(
      JSON.stringify(maxSpendableAmount.data.maxSpendableAmount, null, 2),
    );
    return maxSpendableAmount.data;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
};

let transactionPayload = {};

const consolidateWallet = async (
  assetId: string,
  vaultAccountId: string,
  treasuryVault: string,
): Promise<CreateTransactionResponse | undefined> => {
  const amount = await getMaxSpendableAmount(assetId, vaultAccountId);
  transactionPayload = {
    assetId,
    amount: amount?.maxSpendableAmount,
    source: {
      type: TransferPeerPathType.VaultAccount,
      id: vaultAccountId,
    },
    destination: {
      type: TransferPeerPathType.VaultAccount,
      id: treasuryVault,
    },
  };
  console.log(JSON.stringify(transactionPayload, null, 2));
  try {
    const result = await fireblocks.transactions.createTransaction({
      transactionRequest: transactionPayload,
    });
    console.log(JSON.stringify(result.data, null, 2));
    return result.data;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
};
getMaxSpendableAmount("BTC", "2");
consolidateWallet("BTC", "2", "0");
async function consolidate(vaultAccountId, assetId, treasuryVault){
    let amountToConsolidate = await fireblocks.getMaxSpendableAmount(vaultAccountId, assetId).maxSpendableAmount
    const payload = {
        assetId,
        amount: amountToConsolidate.maxSpendableAmount,
        source: {
            type: PeerType.VAULT_ACCOUNT,
            id: vaultAccountId
        },
        destination: {
            type: PeerType.VAULT_ACCOUNT,
            id: treasuryVault
        },
    };
    const result = await fireblocks.createTransaction(payload);
    console.log(JSON.stringify(result, null, 2));
 }
 consolidate("0", "BTC", "1");
from  fireblocks_sdk import TransferPeerPath, DestinationTransferPeerPath

def consolidate(vault_id: str, asset: str, treasury_id: str):
  amountToConsolidate = fireblocks.get_max_spendable_amount(vault_id, asset)["maxSpendableAmount"]

  fireblocks.create_transaction(
     asset_id=asset,
     amount=amountToConsolidate,
     source=TransferPeerPath(VAULT_ACCOUNT, vault_id),
     destination=DestinationTransferPeerPath(VAULT_ACCOUNT, treasury_id)
  )
  
 consolidate("0", "BTC", "1");
Retrieving the maximum spendable amount for consolidation is used through the getMaxSpendableAmount endpoint.
Do note you need the
vaultId
and
assetId
.
Once we create a transaction with the specified amount, Fireblocks automatically selects all of the inputs (smallest to biggest) to consolidate. You can
contact Fireblocks Support
in order to change the default consolidation selection method and reverse it to a selection going from largest to smallest.
ðŸ“˜
UTXO consolidation to source
You can send a transaction to yourself, thus just consolidating the UTXOs without sending them outwards.
